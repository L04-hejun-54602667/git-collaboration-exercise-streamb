born a poor young country boy
mother nature's son
all day long i am sitting singing songs for everyone

sit beside the mountain street
see a water rise
listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

dududududududududududu....

at the end i feel the grass
mother nature's son
swear in daisy sing a lazy song beneath the sun

dudududududududududududu....
